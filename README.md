# ICS4U CPT - Data Interaction and Visualization - Lydia He
## Dataset
[Link to Data Set](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-growth-the-annual-change-of-the-population)

## Description of Data
The data modelled in this CPT is representative of changes in world population by year. Data displayed will have an x-axis of year and a y-axis of annual population change. With user interaction, a checkbox is available to display data past 2023, and the graph scales accordingly. This future data, of course, is only a prediction. 

## Why I Chose This Dataset
Changes in population are accompanied by a variety of causes and therefore results, and it is important to visualize these changes. Within the next 100 years, this data predicts world population will stop increasing and instead begin decreasing, around the year 2080.
